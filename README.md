# tetris

The game is made of a grid of 10x40 square cells, with various square blocks arranged in groups of 4 coming down one piece at at time. When there is a line of 10 blocks, a row will clear and the remaining blocks will shift down. The more you clear, the faster the pieces fall. The game ends when the blocks reach a vertical height of 20 square grids.

The following project will use HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JS Canvas

An explanation of the major problems you plan to face while implementing this game.
* Collision detection
* Clearing a row
* Figuring out how to make the gameplay smooth
* Making the pieces rotate correctly
* bonus: Allowing for T-Spins
* bonus: Allowing for holding pieces
* bonus: Allowing for adjusting move speeds

I will use Google and youtube to solve the above problems.
